      <h3>Project Title</h3>
      <p>
        (Description of the project)With the numerical representation of graphs that we’ve constructed above 
        (with vectors instead of scalars), we are now ready to build a GNN. 
        We will start with the simplest GNN architecture, one where we learn 
        new embeddings for all graph attributes (nodes, edges, global), but 
        where we do not yet use the connectivity of the graph.
