      <p>
        I am a senior majoring in Operations Research and Engineering at Cornell.
        Planning to pursue a Ph.D. in Operations Research-related fields, I am 
        passionate about applying optimization and simulation methods to inform
        decision-makings that benefit the society.

        <h3>Taxi Routing Optimization</h3>
        <p> Tinghan Ye and David Shmoys</p>
        <p> To be presented at INFORMS Annual Meeting, Oct. 2022.</p>
        <p>
          A taxi routing problem can be solved via bipartite matching, where a maximum cardinality matching 
          corresponds to the minimum number of taxis needed to cover all trips. We proved a min-max theorem:
          the maximum number of pairwise incompatible trips equals the minimum number of taxis needed. We also
          demonstrate on an NYC taxi dataset and obtain 35% reduction in total number of taxis needed.
          Part of my computational work is integrated into a 
          <a href="https://github.com/engri-1101/textbook/tree/master/labs/bipartite_matching"> lab</a> 
          of ENGRI 1101-Engineering Applications of OR.

        <h3>Project Title</h3>
        <p>
          (Description of the project)With the numerical representation of graphs that we’ve constructed above 
          (with vectors instead of scalars), we are now ready to build a GNN. 
          We will start with the simplest GNN architecture, one where we learn 
          new embeddings for all graph attributes (nodes, edges, global), but 
          where we do not yet use the connectivity of the graph.
